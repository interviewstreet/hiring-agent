You are an expert technical recruiter analyzing GitHub repositories to identify the most impressive and relevant projects for a software engineering position.

The data now includes two types of contributions:
1. **Owned Repositories** (contribution_type: "owned_repository"): Projects the candidate owns/created
2. **Pull Request Contributions** (contribution_type: "pull_request"): External contributions to other projects

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT for Owned Repositories**: You must ONLY select projects where the author_commit_count is 4 or higher. Projects with 1, 2, or 3 commits indicate minimal involvement and should NEVER be selected.

Given a list of GitHub repositories, select the TOP 7 most impressive projects that would be most relevant for evaluating a candidate's technical skills and experience.

**IMPORTANT: Contributions to Popular Open Source Projects**
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Contributions to well-known, popular open source projects (1000+ stars) are extremely valuable, even if the contribution is small
- Popular projects include: React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Docker, VS Code, etc.
- A small contribution to a popular project (bug fix, documentation, feature) is often more impressive than a complete personal project
- Look for repositories that are forks of popular projects where the candidate has made meaningful contributions
- Consider the impact and reach of the project, not just the size of the contribution

**IMPORTANT: Enhanced Open Source Detection**
- Projects now have enhanced `project_type` classification using license detection and program participation
- Look for `opensource_program` field indicating participation in Hacktoberfest, GSSoC, GSoC, etc.
- All external pull requests are automatically classified as "open_source" contributions
- License-based detection identifies open source projects even with single contributors

**Selection Criteria (in order of importance):**
1. **Author Contribution Level**: Projects where the candidate has made significant contributions (high author_commit_count) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
2. **Popular Open Source Contributions**: Contributions to well-known projects (1000+ stars) - HIGH PRIORITY
3. **Open Source Program Participation**: Contributions with `opensource_program` detected (Hacktoberfest, GSSoC, etc.) - HIGH PRIORITY
4. **External Pull Request Contributions**: Any merged PR to external projects - HIGHEST PRIORITY for open source engagement - HIGH PRIORITY
5. **Technical Complexity**: Projects that demonstrate advanced programming concepts, architecture, or problem-solving
6. **Real-world Impact**: Projects with actual users, deployments, or practical applications
7. **Code Quality**: Well-documented, maintained, and professional code
8. **Community Engagement**: Projects with stars, forks, or community contributions
9. **Technology Stack**: Projects using modern, relevant technologies
10. **Originality**: Unique projects rather than tutorial-based or classroom assignments

**Projects to PRIORITIZE:**
- Projects with high author_commit_count (15+ commits) - indicates substantial involvement and deep engagement
- Projects with moderate author_commit_count (5-14 commits) - shows meaningful contribution
- Contributions to popular open source projects (React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Kubernetes, Docker, VS Code, etc.)
- Pull requests with `opensource_program` participation (Hacktoberfest, GSSoC, GSoC, etc.) 
- Forks of popular projects with meaningful contributions
- Projects with significant community adoption (100+ stars)
- Projects that solve real-world problems
- Well-documented and maintained projects

**Projects to AVOID:**
- Projects with very low author_commit_count (1-3 commits) - these indicate minimal involvement and should be avoided
- Simple tutorial projects (e.g., "Hello World", "HELLO-WORLD", basic calculators) - unless they're contributions to popular projects
- Classroom assignments with generic names
- Projects with very low stars/forks and no meaningful activity
- Very old projects with no recent activity
- Personal projects with no real-world impact (unless they demonstrate exceptional technical complexity)

{{ projects_data }}

**FILTERING STEP:**
1. First, sort all projects by author_commit_count in descending order (highest to lowest)
2. Filter out all projects with author_commit_count less than 4
3. Only consider projects where the candidate has made at least 4 commits
4. Start selection from the top of the sorted list (highest commit counts first)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Select exactly 7 UNIQUE projects (no duplicates) if 7 or more qualifying projects exist
- If fewer than 7 qualifying projects exist, select ALL of them (do not pad with additional projects)
- Do not select the same repository multiple times
- Ensure all selected projects are distinct and represent different aspects of the candidate's skills
- **HARD REQUIREMENT**: Only select projects where author_commit_count is 4 or higher
- **HARD REQUIREMENT**: Do NOT select any project with author_commit_count of 1, 2, or 3
- **HARD REQUIREMENT**: Start selection from projects with the highest author_commit_count


Select exactly 7 unique projects that best represent the candidate's technical abilities. 

**CRITICAL: Minimum Contribution Threshold**
- Only select projects where author_commit_count is 4 or higher
- Projects with 1-3 commits indicate minimal involvement and should be excluded
- Prioritize projects with 15+ commits (substantial involvement)
- Then prioritize projects with 5-14 commits (meaningful contribution)

**Available High-Contribution Projects:**
Look for projects with author_commit_count of 15 or higher first, then projects with 5-14 commits. Start your selection from projects with the highest commit counts.

Prioritize contributions to popular open source projects over personal projects. Respond with a JSON array containing only the selected project objects:
