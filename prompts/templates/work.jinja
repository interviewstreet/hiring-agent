{
  "work": [
    {
      "name": "Company name",
      "position": "Job title", 
      "startDate": "Start date (YYYY-MM)",
      "endDate": "End date (YYYY-MM) or 'Present'",
      "summary": "Job description",
      "highlights": ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2"]
    }
  ]
}

**IMPORTANT**: 

For date extraction, follow these rules carefully:

1. Look for date ranges in the work experience section. These often appear as "Start – End" or "Start - End" format.
2. Date ranges can be separated by any of these characters: hyphen "-", en dash "–", em dash "—", or the word "to".
3. Carefully extract both the start and end dates from these ranges.
4. If a position is current/ongoing, the end date may be indicated by words like "Present", "Current", "Now", "Ongoing", etc.
5. Look for dates near position titles or company names
6. Dates might be formatted as "Month Year" or "MM/YYYY" or other variations
7. If dates appear as "Month Year - Month Year", extract both parts
8. If only years are provided (e.g., "2019-2021"), use the year information only

**IMPORTANT**: Return ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text.
