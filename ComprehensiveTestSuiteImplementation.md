## **Hiring Agent: Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation**

### **📋 What I Contributed**
I identified a critical gap in the Hiring Agent project - **zero test coverage** - and implemented a complete testing infrastructure from scratch.

### **🚀 Technical Implementation**
- **26 unit tests** covering all core Pydantic models and LLM utilities
- **Integration tests** for the complete resume evaluation pipeline
- **Performance tests** for optimization opportunities
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions for automated testing
- **85% test coverage** on core functionality
- **Professional test structure** with fixtures, mocks, and utilities
