What You’ll Do:

Ship production-level code weekly across Python- and Go-based services, as well as a React/Next.js frontend screening millions of candidates.
Design and implement new microservices - including real-time ranking, interview analytics, and multi-million-dollar payout systems.
Collaborate with senior engineers to profile, test, and harden LLM-powered agents for accuracy, speed, and reliability.
Partner with end users to translate feedback into actionable technical specifications.
Own features end-to-end - from architecture and design to deployment and monitoring.


What We’re Looking For:

Strong Computer Science fundamentals with hands-on experience in Python, Go, or React.
Proven ability to iterate quickly — prototype, test, and ship production code in short cycles.
Passion for system performance and product quality, not just functionality.
Curiosity or familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs), retrieval systems, or ranking algorithms.
Portfolio, GitHub, or side projects that demonstrate real-world problem-solving.
